It seems there was a misunderstanding in your request. You mentioned that you wanted a Python code to be repaired, but the text provided does not contain any Python code. If you have a specific piece of Python code that needs fixing or improvement, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

If you intended to provide code but it wasn't included, please try again by pasting the code here. Once I have the code, I can help identify issues, fix bugs, and improve the code's quality and performance.
