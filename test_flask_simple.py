The provided code is a basic setup for a Flask application with a single route for health checking. There are a few improvements and fixes that can be applied to enhance the code quality and functionality. Below is the revised code along with explanations for each change:

### Revised Code

**main.py**
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
import os

# Check for the existence of the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
if 'OPENAI_API_KEY' not in os.environ:
    raise EnvironmentError('OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set')

# Get the project path from the environment variable
project_path = os.getenv('PROJECT_PATH', '/home/user/project')

# Create the Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Import the routes
import routes  # Importing routes directly

# Print server startup messages
print(f'Server running at http://127.0.0.1:5000')
print('Available endpoints:')
print('/health_check')

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # Enable debug mode for development
```

**routes.py**
```python
from flask import jsonify
from main import app

# Define the health_check route
@app.route('/health_check', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    return jsonify({'status': 'OK'}), 200  # Explicitly return HTTP status code
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Exception Type**: 
   - Changed `Exception` to `EnvironmentError` for raising an error when the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set. This provides a more specific exception type that indicates an issue with the environment configuration.

2. **Importing Routes**:
   - Changed `from routes import *` to `import routes`. This is a better practice as it avoids polluting the namespace and makes it clear where the routes are being imported from.

3. **Debug Mode**:
   - Added `debug=True` in `app.run()`. This is useful during development as it provides detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server on code changes.

4. **HTTP Status Code**:
   - Explicitly returned a status code `200` in the `health_check` route. This makes it clear that the response is successful and adheres to HTTP standards.

5. **Code Comments and Documentation**:
   - Added comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code, which helps in maintaining and understanding the codebase.

6. **Code Formatting**:
   - Ensured consistent formatting and spacing for better readability.

These changes improve the robustness, readability, and maintainability of the code, making it easier to extend and debug in the future.
