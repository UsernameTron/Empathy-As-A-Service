# UnifiedAIPlatform: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Plan

## 1. GitHub Actions CI Workflow

A new workflow file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has been added to automatically:
- Run on every push to `main` or `develop`, and on pull requests to `main`.
- Set up Python 3.10, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Run the test suite using `./test-docker.sh`.
- Generate test coverage with `pytest --cov=. tests/`.

## 2. Docker-based Deployment Automation

The existing `docker-manage.sh` script supports:
- Building images for production and development.
- Starting, stopping, and restarting services.
- Health checks via `check_health` and the separate `health-check.sh` script.
- Backup and restore of volumes.

**Next Steps:**
- Extend `docker-manage.sh` to add `deploy-staging` and `deploy-production` commands for automated deployment (as outlined in the response).
- Integrate these commands into a future GitHub Actions CD workflow for push-to-deploy.

## 3. Health Monitoring

- The `health-check.sh` script provides comprehensive health checks for all system components and is ready for integration into CI/CD and monitoring solutions.

## 4. Environment Management

- Environment variables are managed via `.env` and checked in health scripts. Future improvements will add environment-specific configuration for deployment targets.

## Summary

The repository now includes a CI workflow and is ready for further CD automation. This addresses the main critique and elevates the project toward a production-grade CI/CD setup.
